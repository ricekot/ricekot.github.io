In order to keep things interesting and avoid plateauing as a programmer, I'm starting a new series of posts tagged `experiments`.

I want to keep learning and growing, and I think that is only possible if I'm deliberate about it.

There are a lot of cool tools and technologies that I've been reading about and I want to start getting my hands dirty.

That being said, I don't want my posts to be about downloading some tool, setting it up, and doing the "Hello, World!" equivalent with it.
Ideally, each experiment is going to be about building something unique and meaningful. It doesn't have to be useful, but it does have to be original.

I don't like setting timelines when it comes to my blog (because I've seen too many blogs with a single post that promises a new post every week), but I'll still aim for one experiment per month, simply to have a sense of urgency and keep things moving. I'm not making any promises though ðŸ˜›.
