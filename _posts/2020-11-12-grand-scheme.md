I recently began reading "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" as part of my "[Learning Computer Science](/tycs/)" project. I'm already enjoying it, and I'm going to be posting my notes and exercise solutions on this blog. Here's some of the stuff I've read about until now.

### Applicative vs. Normal Order of Evaluation

| Applicative Order                       | Normal Order                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "evaluate the arguments and then apply" | "fully expand and then reduce" |

MIT Scheme follows the applicative order of evaluation.

### Functions vs. Procedures

| Functions                                       | Procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "what is"                                       | "how to"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| e.g. "$y$ is the square root of $x$ if $y^2=x$. | e.g. [Heron's method of computing square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method): $y_{n+1}=\frac{y_n+\frac{y_n}{x}}{2};\,\,n\in\mathbb{N}$ where $y_0$ is the initial guess. The value approximation $y_n$ of the square root of $x$ improves with each recursive step. |

### Recursion and Iteration 

| Recursion                                                                         | Iteration                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recursion is a process that can be described as *a chain of deferred operations*. | Iteration is a process that can be descibed completely, at any moment in time, by a fixed number of state variables. |

There is a difference between a *recursive process* and a *recursive procedure*. A recursive procedure refers to the syntax of calling a procedure within its own definition. A process is called recursive based on how it evolves when it is executed.

I was quite surprised to learn that an iterative process can be generated by a recursive procedure. For example, consider the following two procedures that computer the factorial of a given positive integer.

```scheme
(define (fact-recur n) (
    (if (= n 1) 1
                (* n (fact-recur (- n 1))))))
```

```scheme
(define (fact-iter n) (
    (define (iter product count) (
        (if (> count n) product
                        (iter (* count product) (+ count 1)))))
    (iter 1 1))
```

Both `fact-recur` and `iter` are recursive procedures. However, `fact-iter` will generate an iterative process on execution. Look at the solution of Exercise 1.9 below for a better understanding. 

The implementation of a programming language is said to be *tail-recursive* if an iterative process described by a recursive procedure is executed as an iterative process. Scheme is a tail-recursive implementation. For other languages, iterative processes must be explicitly expressed with keywords like `for`, `while`, or `do`.

### My solutions to the first 10 exercises from Chapter 1

#### Exercise 1.1
```
10 12 8 3 6 a b 19 #f 4 16 6 16
```

#### Exercise 1.2
```scheme
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 2 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```

#### Exercise 1.3
```scheme
(define (bruh a b c)
        (if (> a b) (if (> b c) (sos a b) (sos a c))
                    (if (> a c) (sos a b) (sos b c))))

(define (sos x y) (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
```

#### Exercise 1.4
The procedure calculates `a + b` if b is positive and `a - b` if b is negative. In other words, it calculates `a + |b|`.

#### Exercise 1.5
With an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation, the expression cannot be evaluated. This is because the interpreter will get stuck when it tries to evaluate `(p)`. `(p)` will evaluate to `(p)` and the interpreter will keep trying to simplify it with no luck.

An interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation will never encounter `(p)` and the program will return 0.

#### Exercise 1.6
The interpreter will get stuck in an infinite recursive loop and nothing will be returned.
This is because scheme uses applicative-order evaluation. This means that the arguments of a procedure are evaluated before the procedure is applied. Since `new-if` is a procedure and not a special form, the interpreter calls `sqrt-iter` each time it tries to evaluate the else-clause of `new-if`. As a result,  `new-if` is never applied and `guess` is never returned even if it is `good-enough?`

#### Exercise 1.7
The guess is considered good enough if the improved guess is within 0.1% of the original guess.

```scheme
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- guess (improve guess x))) (* 0.001 guess)))
```

#### Exercise 1.8
```scheme
(define (cbrt-iter old-guess guess x)
  (if (cbrt-good-enough? old-guess guess) guess
        (cbrt-iter guess
                    (cbrt-improve guess x)
                    x)))

(define (cbrt-improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (* guess guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))

(define (cbrt-good-enough? old-guess guess)
  (< (abs (- old-guess guess)) (* 0.001 old-guess)))

(define (cbrt x)
  (cbrt-iter 0 1.0 x))
```

#### Exercise 1.9
The first procedure generates a recursive process.

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

The second procedure generates an iterative process.

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```

#### Exercise 1.10
`(A 1 0)` = 1024  
`(A 2 4)` = 65536  
`(A 3 3)` = 65536

$f(n)=2n$

$$
g(n)={\left\lbrace\begin{matrix}{0}&{\quad\text{if}\quad}{n}={0}\\
    2^n&{\quad\text{if}\quad}{n}\ge{1}\end{matrix}\right.}
$$

$$
h(n)={\left\lbrace\begin{matrix}{0}&{\quad\text{if}\quad}{n}={0}\\
    2&{\quad\text{if}\quad}{n}={1} \\
    2^{h(n-1)}&{\quad\text{if}\quad}{n}\ge{2}\end{matrix}\right.}
$$

### My Scheme Setup
It's irrelevant but, I'm using [CHICKEN](https://www.call-cc.org/) on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
