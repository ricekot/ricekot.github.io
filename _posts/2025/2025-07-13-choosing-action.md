description: Consciously building a bias for action.

I think I've been spending too much time just thinking about things lately.

I need to build a [bias towards action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_bias).
I need to do it consciously, until it becomes second nature for me.
And it starts with this blog post.

From one of my favourite videos on the internet,

<center>
<table style="table-layout: auto; width: 75%;">
<tbody>
<tr><td align="center">
Action is a life-giving breath; inaction is a slow death.
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">
<div class="responsive-iframe-container">
<iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIVVQkZtnAU?modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&theme=light&color=white" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>

I simply cannot spend the rest of my life in a reactive manner, just going with the flow.
I need to be in the driver's seat.

It's VERY easy to come up with excuses for not taking action.
You could be afraid of uncertainty, or you could be an overthinker.
Or maybe you're a perfectionist who wants to do great work, and anything less is unacceptable.
Scratch that.
Stop thinking, start doing.
