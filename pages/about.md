Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is Akshath Kothari and I'm currently a student at BITS Pilani, India. In my spare time I work on writing code and documentation for [OWASP ZAP](https://zaproxy.org/) as a core team member.

I use this blog to document any interesting ideas I encounter and to write technical posts related to programming, mathematics and engineering. The contents of this blog reflect my personal opinions.

<h2> Projects </h2>

Most of the stuff I learn or work on is available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ricekot/). I also have a [projects page](/projects/) on this website.

<h2> Art </h2>

In my first two years at college, I had a lot of fun editing videos for cultural and technical festivals. You can view some of these on the [art page](/art/).
