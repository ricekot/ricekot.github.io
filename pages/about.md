Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is Akshath Kothari.
I'm currently working on cool stuff at [Levo.ai](https://levo.ai), and I'm also a [core team member](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/team/ricekot/) for the open-source [OWASP ZAP](https://zaproxy.org) project.

I use this blog to document any interesting ideas I encounter and to write technical posts related to programming, mathematics and engineering. The contents of this blog reflect my personal opinions.

My handle *ricekot* may be broken up into "rice" and "kot".
My first name, "Akshath" (अक्षत, /ʌkʃəθ/), means "rice" in Hindi.
"kot" is nothing but the first three letters of my last name, "Kothari" (कोठारी, /kotʰari/).

## Projects

Most of the stuff I learn or work on is available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ricekot/). I also have a [projects page](/projects/) on this website.

## Art

In my first two years at college, I had a lot of fun editing videos for cultural and technical festivals. You can view some of these on the [art page](/art/).
