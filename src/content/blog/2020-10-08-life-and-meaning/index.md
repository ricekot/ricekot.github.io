~ Friedrich Nietzsche

I read this quote in Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning*. I recall my friend saying something similar to me back when we were preparing for competitive exams.

For a long time since then, I've been trying to find meaning in my life. I've been questioning everything I do. Each time I reach the same answer. There is no *why*. It doesn't matter what I do, because nothing matters. 

These nihilistic thoughts were what used to occupy a major chunk of my time. I couldn't focus on anything else, because I couldn't - and still can't - see how any of my actions matter in the grand scheme of things.

Yuval Noah Harari writes in *Sapiens*, "There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings."

And I believe Mr. Robot when he says, "We live in a kingdom of bullshit."

The only reason I'm able to question everything I do is because life has been easy for me ever since I was born. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be asking all these questions if I had to spend 60 hours a week  working minimum wage to support my family. This brings up another question - is all of this just an excuse? Is this just me trying to justify my inadequacy?

I don't know. 

Cal Newport writes in *So Good They Can't Ignore You*, “If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset (“what can the world offer me?”) and instead adopt the craftsman mindset (“what can I offer the world?”).”

I think he hits the nail right on the head. Life isn't about taking, it's about giving back. How will you contribute to your species? As the way I am right now, I don't have much to offer the world, honestly speaking. I have to - and want to - keep learning and reading and improve my understanding of the world.

Shoko Makinohara says to Sakuta in *Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai*, "What I think, Sakuta-kun, is that life is here for us to become kinder. I live life every day hoping I was a slightly kinder person than I was the day before."

My actions no longer feel inconsequential when my goal is to propel my species to greater heights. I become part of a larger movement. I feel I can bear almost any *how*, because I have a *why*. It doesn't matter if everything is meaningless - I'm okay with taking part in the farce if that is what inches me closer to my goal. Besides, I'm very curious. I like learning about how things work, and how they can be made better. So I guess that, at least for now, that's how I'm going to be spending my time.
